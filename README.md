This SQL query is designed to retrieve specific data from the ExpenseTracker database. The query demonstrates the following SQL concepts:

SELECT: Used to retrieve specific columns (ExpenseID, Category, Description, Amount, Date).

Wildcards (LIKE '%...'): Used to filter categories and descriptions that contain specific keywords (e.g., "food", "transport").

Comparison Operators (>, =): Applied to filter results where the expense amount is greater than 100, and to exclude the "Entertainment" category.

Logical Operators (AND, OR, NOT): Used to combine multiple conditions effectively:

AND ensures that both conditions (wildcards and amount comparison) are met.

OR allows for either "food" category or "transport" description.

NOT excludes "Entertainment" category.

ORDER BY: Orders the results by the Date column in descending order, showing the most recent expenses first.
